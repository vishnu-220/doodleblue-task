  Installation Instructions
  -------------------------

  With npm on command line:
  
    Directly from npm registry https://npmjs.org/ :
      
      Go to your node application (your project) and in the same folder write.

      $ npm install websmscom
      
      done...
    
    OR in case you downloaded the package
      
      Put this file next to your node application in the same folder.

      $ npm install websmscom-1.0.1.tgz 
      
        will create a local ./node_modules in the current directory
        
        In this directory you can now do "var websms = require('./websmscom')" in your js programs
    
    
    OR just unpack / unzip websmscom-1.0.1.tgz 
    
      Put this file next to your node application in the same folder.
             
      $ tar -xf websmscom-1.0.1.tgz
        
        will unpack it to a directory named 'package' wherefrom you can install it:
        
      $ npm install ./package
        
        In this directory you can now do "var websms = require('./websmscom')" in your js programs
      
      
    And that's it.
  
  
  Additional Installation Info
  ----------------------------    
  
  
  In case you want to install it globally (add -g to any install suggestions above):
  
    $ sudo npm install -g websmscom-1.0.1.tgz
  
  If globally installed, websmscom can be called directly to send sms like:
    $ websmscom --send --m="This is the message text" --r=4369912345678 --u Username --p Password
