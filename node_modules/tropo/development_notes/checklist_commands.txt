When adding/modifying commands
------------------------------
- ensure that any syntax change is reflected in 'tropo help'
- ensure that life cycle is correct:
  . general behavior
  . special cases for specific entities
  examples:
  . adding the same user should result in an error
  . removing a non-existing user should result in an error
  . removing user 'admin' should result in an error
